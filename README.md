# Character_level_LSTM_model
## As part of the prerequisites for the Udacity Introduction to Deep Learning Nanodegree course, this character-level LSTM model was developed to fulfill the course requirements.

This model  was built to make a character-level prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network called Long Short term memory (LSTM) algorithm using pyTorch framework. The network will be trained character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. As an example, I will train on [Anna Karenina](https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/anna-karenina-ebook.html). This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the book!

This network is based off of [Andrej Karpathy's](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) post on RNNs and [implementation in Torch](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn)

## Requirements
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Recurrent Neural Network (Long Short Term Memory)
- [Anna Karenina](https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/anna-karenina-ebook.html)
